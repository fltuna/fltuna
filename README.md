Also discussion thread is public so all of contents are visible to everyone.

If you want to discuss privately, Please send Email to my [Gmail](mailto:faketuna.st@gmail.com). You need to include "From GitHub" (e.g. From GitHub Profile. Hello! I have questions about blah blah) in subject, otherwise will be ignored.
